Build Instructions

If you are just testing I recommend just trying it out at the link above, compiling will take about 5 minutes and you need to install a few packages first.

If you really want to run it locally:

git clone the repo

cd in 

run the below command

brew install --cask dotnet-sdk && dotnet workload install wasm-tools && dotnet publish -c Release
